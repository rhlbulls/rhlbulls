## How did I create rhlbulls.com?

rhlbulls.com is a completely statically generated site built using Gatsby. All the blogs present in rhlbulls.com are fetched from a repo containing static markdown files and parsing it out for the sections.

A github actions workflow is responsible for rebuilding the site in netlify everytime there is push to main branch.
